At the beginning of studying college test, around March-April, I was confused about where to start learning, what to study, and what to do. Then, I just learned from everywhere, even from Twitter too. I never set aside time to make a material list.

I made a study schedule but was still confused about what to study. I also did many tryouts, but that's it, because there is no new material to be learned.

Recently, it's become clear that there's a lot of material that I haven't touched or finished yet. I just realized **the importance of preparing**. If we do a work without preparation, it will not be optimal.

It's okay to start late so we can prepare first, so later it will be easier, just follow the steps we have prepared. Abraham Lincoln even said,

> "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four **sharpening the axe**."

And that's really true.

However, this doesn't apply to things that need to be prepared by trial and error, like a business.
