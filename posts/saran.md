For people who are new in a field, the most effective way to grow is to ask for advice from people who are already considered good at that field, as many said.

If you want to start a business, then seek advice from Sandiaga Uno or Erick Thohir. If you want to be good at writing, follow Tere Liye. If you want to be singer, ask Raisa.

But actually, <mark>their suggestions may not even be relevant for us</mark>. Why?

No offense, but they are already far above our level, so all the steps, tactics, strategies they use are also at a different level from us. Doesn't even fit.

The things that are important for beginners like us, they probably don't know anymore. They have been in their field for a long time and **no longer need** to go through the "beginners" period.

Even if they still know, usually there must be certain conditions that we must fulfill first if we want to carry out their advice. And yes, it just mean that it doesn't fit with us.

As beginners we should need advice that is practical, can be done and proven to have an effect on our growth.

In my opinion, such rich suggestions can only be obtained from people who are <mark>slightly</mark> above us.

They've passed everything we will be through, but not too far. Just a step or two ahead of us.

So they still really understand what is important and what beginners really need to do, so we can grow well without having to go through the problems they have gone through.

They can guide us so we don't fall into the same hole they've been in.

And for people who are already legend at the field, the hole they've been before may have been closed a long time ago, thus irrelevant to us.
