There's nothing wrong with having a goal. We've even discussed [the importance of goals](/goal/). But if we focus too much on that goal, it actually lowers our chances of achieving that goal. But how?

We think that when a big goal is achieved, it will be a turning point in our lives. In fact, usually, after that big goal is achieved, according to human nature, we will only be satisfied for a moment, and soon we will look for another goal that is bigger and more ambitious.

So, if we focus on the goal and don't achieve that goal, especially the long-term one, we will most likely feel like a failure, frustrated, and impatient.

It would be better if we just focus on the process, enjoy every process and every progress that exists. We can also develop ourselves to be more resilient if we fail and create our own system. Here is how.

## Find out where we are

Even though we have a map and it's clear where we're going, we won't be able to get there if we don't know where we are **now**. So before we start, we need to be aware of where exactly we are. What are our strengths, what are our weaknesses, what do we have, etc.

## Find the right path

After knowing where we are and where we want to go, all we have to do is find a way to get there. Don't get lost, don't go the wrong way. Look for things and activities that can help and get us to our destination. Write them down.

## Try another road

Do not be too comfortable with the way that you are already familiar with. There might be a road that is faster to arrive. Broaden your horizons, try all the possible things according to what you want.

## Evaluate

From that experiment, evaluate which activities that are really suitable for our goals. If it works, go on. If it doesn't, throw it away. We want fast results, but we like it or not, we have to be consistent. In order to be consistent, we must like it. So, choose what you like. Make it fun.

Everyone has their own way, their own system, so maybe this doesn't work for everyone.
