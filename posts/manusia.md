Should we be proud to be human?

## Industrial Revolution

Recently, before the outbreak of the epidemic, one of the most widely discussed issues was the **Industrial Revolution 4.0** and all its details; _big data, AI, machine learning,_ etc. This is indeed worth discussing because it has and will continue to completely change our lives, opening up as wide as possible all opportunities and ideas that have never been thought of before.

When James Watt started the world's first steam engine in 1776 (1.0), when the Ford factory started using electricity and conveyor belts in its factories (2.0), when Alan Turing managed to complete the first computer to crack Nazi ciphers (3.0), and when everything started to connect to the _Internet of Things_ (4.0), what happened was almost certain. Everyting is getting better, faster, cheaper, and more efficient.

Well, if you look closely, **Industrial Revolution 4.0** which is still going on right now is moving the main role from **industry** into the hands of **information**.

Now, there are many jobs that are taken over or automated by machines and robots, most of them are repetitive jobs, such as cashier, toll gate guard, beverage seller, etc. This is because machines and robots can and will certainly do these jobs better and faster. And recently, even cognitive work, which requires intelligence, can be done by robots. On February 17, 1996 the world was shocked by the loss of world chess champion Garry Kasparov to Deep Blue, an IBM AI that was able to predict 200 million moves per second.

So in general all human jobs can and/or will be replaced by robots, from cashiers to maybe rocket designers, and all of these robots are connected on the _Internet of Things_ network. They will be able to record all the things we experience, do, and feel, then save it to a giant database that we know as _Big Data_.

## Industry ➡️ Information

The birth of _Artificial Intelligence_ and _Big Data_ causes us as humans to inevitably give up industrial tasks to be done by robots. Our task now is to utilize the information network in this huge _Big Data_, so that it can be useful and make our lives easier. This is a job that is predicted to be [one of job with the brightest prospect](https://becominghuman.ai/data-scientist-and-their-future-is-seen-bright-for-job-analysts-7b646864e14c) in the future, _Data Scientist_. Examples of their work are recommendations for our needs in _e-commerce_ and another movie recommendation in online streaming services which is based on what we've watched.

However, human capabilities are very limited and it is impossible to process the millions of available data, while it is very unfortunate if this _Big Data_ is not utilized. Therefore, scientists are developing a super network/_supernet_, which consists of computational algorithms¹ created by humans which thanks to AI can develop their own algorithms independently without human intervention, which will be able to process Big Data correctly and will certainly be millions of times smarter than humans.

Update: [It's happening.](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3596894/todays-data-science-roles-wont-exist-in-10-years.html)

## Welcome to The New Era

*Supernet*² – with its gigantic information management – ​​will be very helpful to humans if it is actually realized. It will know us better than ourselves and know what is the best for us. Making important decisions in life will depend on what the _supernet_ says, and we will believe it because we believe the _supernet_ knows everything. At this point, it is very possible for someone to become an atheist, because for them the Qur'an and the Bible are no longer relevant to today's life, and on the _supernet_ they depend. _Na'udzubillahi min zaalik_.

The signs of the emergence and superiority of _supernet_ are visible now. Millions of people give up their privacy to be known by Google and Facebook in order to be able to participate in the flow of _Big Data_ and feel the great benefits.

Furthermore, it is not impossible for _supernet_ to treat humans, as just another complex algorithm. _Supernet_ may feel that its level is above humans because the its algorithm is much more complex than humans.

Well, from 70,000 years ago, since Homo sapiens started walking on earth – according to Darwin's theory – humans have always been the most meaningful, most important, and most influential creatures on earth. Humans are in the center of everything, as mentioned in the opening statement,

> Everything that exists or happens on earth, is judged to be good or bad depending on its effect on humans, not for animals, plants, even the earth itself.

This is because humans have **intelligence** and **consciousness**. Some animals might be called smart, such as dolphins, chimpanzees, or dogs. But none of the animals **realized** that they could do anything great. If there is, maybe the elephant is the ruler of the world now.

However, if intelligence and awareness, our two crucial abilities as humans, are only considered as complex algorithms, while the _supernet_ is the owner of the best algorithm, then the _supernet_ will become the next most meaningful, most important, and most influential creature.

It might seem impossible because the _supernet_ will be intangible, but so are countries and organizations. These two things are intangible but countless of people are willing to sacrifice their lives for these intangible things.

## What's next?

So far, we can provide two possibilities.

First, the _supernet_ will be self-serving. Because it was created by _AI_ and _machine learning_ so that it can be cognitively better than humans and humans can't even understand it, the _supernet_ can assume that the system is the priority, and humans are just objects. If the lower classes of humans would only slow down progress if rescued, then the _supernet_ would prefer to eliminate them. Sound not good for me.

Second, the _supernet_ will care about humans. Even though it is better than humans in many way and it awares of that, it is also possible that the _supernet_ remains loyal to humans. It will do, produce, and give everything we have never thought of for the evolution of mankind. _Supernet_ can take ownership of assets, so that inequality can be erased and prosperity can be enjoyed by everyone. This will be the pinnacle of human success. Related to this, Prof. Harari – a history professor – said that with technology, _Homo sapiens_ would turn into _Homo deus_.

¹Algorithm: A sequence of how to do something that is usually very complicated. Cooking recipes are examples of algorithms.

²Supernet is just a personal term for example.
