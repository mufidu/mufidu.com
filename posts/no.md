Warren Buffet, one of the wealthiest people in the world once said that the difference between a successful person and a very very successful person is that very successful people almost always reject anything.

But don't we often hear that if you want to be successful, take as many opportunities as you can?

Well, that doesn't mean taking as many opportunities as possible, but taking opportunities that add benefits to us and take advantage of them **as well as possible**.

We all only have a little time, 24 hours a day. Our energy is also limited, we are always tired at the end of the day. So it's impossible for us to work on and pursue all the opportunities that exist.

It's better to focus the time and energy that we have on things that give value to us.

Don't let other people decide what to do. Only we should know which ones we really have to work on, and which ones we can leave behind.

Every time we are asked to do something, refuse it until we find the reasons and benefits of that thing. John C. Maxwell, the author of many New York Times Bestsellers, once said,

> “Learn to say ‘no’ to the good so you can say ‘yes’ to the best”.
