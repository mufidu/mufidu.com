A few months ago, when I started writing here, I was able to write a post once a day, writings that weren't posted could even be up to three times a day. I was very diligent in writing at that time because after graduating from high school, I feel that I have learned a lot of lessons, thank God. I will regret if they just disappear, so I wrote it down and posted it here.

I first started this blog in June 2018, to make my post about organization, because at that time, I was just about to start joining organizations when I was in high school. But, in 2018 I only posted two posts, and 2019 was the same, two posts too. It started to be more active since July 1, 2020.

But writing once a day only lasted until the 17th of that month, then it decrease to every three days, once a week, three times a month, until last September until now, I haven't posted anything at all.

There are many factors. I have a many tryouts' schedules for my college test preparation almost every day, and I take care of many registrations. Moreover, I am unable to make time and just really lazy.

I want to start writing again because I feel like I already have ideas that I can write about. I've always written based on my writing itch, write what I want to write. So I don't have a schedule. Last July, I just happened to have a lot that I wanted to write about.

In this website I also don't choose a particular niche, because all posts are really what I want to write about, and they can be anything.

Moreover, I also don't make money here, although actually I can because this blog has been approved by Google Adsense so I can post ads, but I don't really care about it, because ads are really annoying sometimes and make very little money, I just checked yesterday I got 300 from Adsense. IDR 300 (about 0.021 USD).

I write and post here just because I want to, I want to have something that I built from **zero**, which I actually built myself, so there are things I can do when I have free time, and it has results, it has forms.
