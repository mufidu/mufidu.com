We all know that our time is very limited. So maybe it's better if we don't expect too much that we will be able to finish everything we want.

Subconsciously, when we say "yes" to one thing, we actually say "no" to another thing.

Choose one [goal](/goal/), and [don't say yes](/say-no/) to anything that is not in line with that goal.

Every few days, take a little time to check whether everything we do is having an effect on our goals. If not, don't do it again no matter how far we've gone. Let's not stray any further.
