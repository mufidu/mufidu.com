üë©üèª: "Look. That beggar is really annoying, huh. He asks money to everyone who passes by."

üßë: "Yeah, however he's a beggar."

üë©üèª: "Yes. But he should be more ethical, right, who knows if the person is in a hurry. He should try to beg more smartly. Won't it be better?"

üßë: "Well, you shouldn't think like that. If he was good at ethics, smart, and has good communication, he won't be a beggar, but a lawyer."

Differences of opinion are something that very common in this day, following people's diverse perspectives on everything.

Every human being has their own point of view, which is formed by the various experiences they've had during their life.

For example, a successful entrepreneur must see knowledge as unimportant thing, but practice is important, because he has seen that his friends who fail in business are those who are only good at theory and never practice.

However, a scientist will see practice without knowledge as nonsense and even dangerous, because they have seen that his friends who failed in the experiment were those who only tried an experiment without understanding the object.

Now, because every human being lives a different life and has various experiences and insights, there are countless points of view that can be taken to look at life; event, tragedy, experience, incident, and commotion.

We often see humans debating certain phenomena, fighting for their point of view to be the most correct.
It can be in terms of religion, economics, and from other aspects.

Then, we are confused.

Which point of view is correct?

If we want the truth, the most likely way is to follow the point of view of the person who is most familiar with the problems.

When it comes to religion, follow the opinion of the imam.

When it comes to education, follow the opinions of scholars.

When it comes to technology, follow the advice of the technicians.

Especially in this era, hoaxes and post-truths are often spread, so more effort is needed to uncover the truth from behind the fog.

Wrong and distorted sources should not be used as a reference.

After getting to the truth, we will meet people who have different views. Their views are completely different, but it is not impossible that they contain the same truth value. A debate began to test whether it was appropriate to defend that view.

In fact, if that's the case, maybe it's time to open your mind to each other. By looking at it from the opponent's point of view, annoyance, envy, and irritation will be replaced with respect and disdain.

Reach for the truth by combining thoughts, not bringing each other down, because everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Solve the difference problem.

Finally,
Let's call this diversity instead of difference, because it's not difference that provokes conflict, but diversity that makes up perfection.
