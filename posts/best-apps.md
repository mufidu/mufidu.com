In my daily life, I always use various applications to support my productivity. There are so many different apps developed and available for us to use, and I always want to use the best apps for each task. I'm even willing to spend a few hours trying to figure out which app is the best for me.

I'm writing this because I want to share my so-called research results, so that people might be able to save some time without having to research for other apps again. Here are the best applications that I use according to their use case. All of them are Android apps, some are also on Windows.

## Note-taking

I usually use a notetaking app as a place for documenting everything, from ideas that I have to write down because it's a shame if they get lost, cool articles I find on the internet, to the thoughts of my brain that are passing through but are unique and cool. I document them in one application, namely **[Notion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notion.id&hl=en&gl=US)**.

I've tried various other note-taking apps, such as Evernote, OneNote, Slite, and Google Keep. For me, Notion remains the best.

Indeed, I used to go back to Evernote, but in the end I still moved to Notion, because its very diverse features can't be found in other note-taking applications. The drawback is only one, there must be an internet connection. But today, who doesn't have internet?

![Notion](/img/notion.webp)

But maybe most of the features can be confusing to use, so if you only use it for simple regular notes, I recommend Evernote. It looks really good. Unfortunately there is an upload limit which is only 60 MB per month, so I can't upload a lot of photos.

Overall, [Notion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notion.id&hl=en&gl=US).

_Update:_ Now I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I started to hate that all my notes are only exist on one online platform that I don't know how long it will last. In Obsidian, I can set up my notes to be saved locally and regularly backed up to several cloud storages. I can also set up my notes to be encrypted.

However, Notion is still very good if you want many features and collaboration.

## To-do-list

The to-do-list application is important so that we don't have to think too much about something that must be done but the deadline is still next week.

If there is a task like that, we can put it on the to-do-list instead.

I've tried Todoist, Google Task, Microsoft To Do, Any.do, and TickTick. Just tried the free tier btw, because I still don't need to pay just for a to-do-list. The app with the best free tier in my opinion is **[TickTick](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notion.id&hl=en&gl=US)**.

Other apps' free tier always have flaws that make me unable to continue using it. There are those who can't repeat tasks, and some can't even send reminder.

![TickTick](/img/tick.webp)

There are two things that I really like about TickTick, first it can sync on phones and laptops and other devices, so you can create and view your tasks anywhere.

Second, it has widgets on phones and laptops, and we can create new tasks without having to open the application using the shortcut. This is really helpful, so we can always see the list on the home screen.

## Money manager

I used to be quite a spendthrift, so I decided to keep track of all my expenses and income.

![Wallet](/img/wallet.webp)

The applications that I have tried are Wallet, Money Manager, Monefy, Money Lover, and Spendee. In my opinion the best is [Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droid4you.application.wallet&hl=en&gl=US), because there are no ads and the features are complete, you can even connect to your bank account if you buy the premium one for about $18 (lifetime!).

## Book

Since in high school, I really like reading books, and after graduating I prefer e-books because they are very flexible. I can read anything anywhere as long as I bring my phone.

At first I bought several books on Google Play Books, until recently I found an application that you can subscribe and then get access to thousands of Indonesian fiction and non-fiction books, namely [Gramedia Digital](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droid4you.application.wallet&hl=en&gl=US).

![Gramedia](/img/gramed.webp)

The subscription price is really good, IDR 89K for the fiction + nonfiction package. But one account can have 5 people, so if you share an account it can be just around IDR 18K per person.

_Update:_ Now a Gramedia Digital account can only be used by two people. Because the price becomes quite expensive, I now use [iPusnas](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mam.reader.ipusnas&hl=en_US&gl=US) which is quite good, even though we have to struggle sometimes :).

## Quran & Prayer times

There are so many qur'an applications and prayer schedules available, and most of them are all-in-one applications, so in an app there is the quran, prayer schedule, Qibla, prayers, dhikr, etc.

But usually all-in-one applications have ads that are quite annoying and require us to pay to get rid of those ads. So I prefer one application for the qur'an, and another one application for the prayer schedule.

The qur'an application that I use is [Qur'an for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quran.labs.androidquran&hl=en&gl=US) from [quran. com](https://quran.com). In this app, the quran is per page, not per verse like other applications. There are also many murottals that can be played per verse. Very cool. No more ads.

![quran](/img/qurancom.webp)

For prayer schedule I'm using [Prayer Times and Qibla](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reworewo.prayertimes&hl=en&gl=US). It can show prayer schedules on the home screen that we can customize according through a widget.

![prayer-times](/img/prayertimes.webp)

We can also set the notification so that it is always on even if our phone is in Silent or Do Not Disturb (DND) mode. In App Purchase is not really needed because it only adds Themes and can play adhan from our phones.

## Brain trainer

I've tried Lumosity, Peak, Elevate, and NeuroNation. Most of them require a membership, usually costs hundreds of thousands IDR per year.

The free tier often limits the games we can try, and the games aren't adapting to our abilities (it means same start point every day). Except [NeuroNation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.nn.mobile.app.main&hl=en&gl=US). This is what I use.

[NeuroNation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.nn.mobile.app.main&hl=en&gl=US)'s free tier can give us a recommendation of 5 games per day according to our abilities level, so we can monitor our progress continuously. But one of the five games will be locked.

![NeuroNation](/img/neuronation.webp)

For the paid version, I think the most worth it is [Peak](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainbow.peak.app&hl=en&gl=US), with a price of IDR 250K per person or IDR 500K for 5 people, and both are lifetime.

## Language learning

I've only tried two apps in this category, Duolingo and Memrise. But it seems pretty clear that the winner is [Duolingo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&hl=en&gl=US).

The free version of Memrise is very limited while Duolingo in the free version already provides everything. Starting from grammar, vocabulary, to stories for teaching how to use the sentences in everyday life.

![Duolingo](/img/duolingo.webp)

Duolingo Plus itself only adds offline learning features and removes ads, but I've never seen the ads even though they're always connected to the internet, so there's no need to upgrade.

These are some of the applications that I use on a daily basis. All of them are the best apps in their category, at least in my opinion. You can try it for your consideration.
