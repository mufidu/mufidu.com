## About the site

There are two reasons I build this site:

1. I often suddenly get a pretty good idea or just a random thought, but then just forget them. I hate it so I started dumping my thoughts in notes, (I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)).

2. I also often face some problems in my daily life (escpecially during development involving codes). I think it would be better to document my solution in notes, too. So other people don't need to get the same confusion as I did.

Some good notes will be edited and published here.

This site is built with performance as a priority, so it's pretty simple. All the cool stuff is in [my other projects](/projects/).
