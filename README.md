Hey! Sorry because this website has not been fancy-designed yet. Fyi, this site is automatically generated by GitHub Pages just from [a README file](https://github.com/mufidu/mufidu.com/blob/main/README.md).

Take a look at the other pages:

-   [Things I've made](https://mufidu.com/projects)
-   [Now](https://mufidu.com/now)
-   [Blog](https://blog.mufidu.com) -> dynamic
-   [Blog](https://mufidu.com/blog) -> static. faster but still so raw. 

Or the other links:

-   [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu)
-   [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mufidu)
-   [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mufidu_)
-   [Email](mailto:me@mufidu.com)
