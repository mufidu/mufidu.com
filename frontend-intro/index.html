                        >, front-end web development is the practice of
                        converting data to a graphical interface, through the
                        use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view
                        and interact with that data.
                    </p>

                    <p class="content">
                        We can say that front-end web developers are they who
                        architect the "front-end" of a website. They build
                        everything we see in a website, therefore they are
                        responsible for the user experience.
                    </p>

                    <p class="content">
                        The main goal of front-end web development is how to
                        deliver the best user experiences. Front-end web
                        developers must ensure that users understand the purpose
                        of the web, by making usable user interfaces.

                        How about the database, server side, etc? That's why
                        back-end web developers exist.
