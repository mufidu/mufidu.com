## Currently working on

-   [My personal website](https://mufidu.com)

    This is the very website you are visiting now. I haven't started this one, either ðŸ˜…. As you can see in [the repo](https://github.com/mufidu/mufidu.com), it's all just markdown. Generated to HTML by Jekyll, automatically after every `git push`.

## Currently watching

-   [Breaking Bad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/)

    Many people in Quora say that this is the best show airing right now. So, after finishing [Prison Break](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455275/), I decided to binge this show. But currently, I have many shits to done so I have to postpone this for later. :(

-   [Agent Carter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3475734/)

    I like her.

-   [Rick and Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/)
