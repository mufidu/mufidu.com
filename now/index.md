These are things I'm doing at the moment. Part of [/now movement](https://nownownow.com).

## Currently reading

## Currently learning

- [The Web Developer Bootcamp - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

  It's where my journey to web development began. I did many practices and projects while doing this course, but still haven't finished it yet.

- [Germany - Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/course/de/en/Learn-German)

  It's cool to be a polyglot, right?

## Currently working on

- [My personal website](https://mufidu.com)

  This is the very website you are visiting now. I just started rebuilding this website, using 11ty and [this theme](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog). Just started to customizing it.

## Currently watching

- [Breaking Bad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/)

  Many people in Quora say that this is the best show airing right now. So, after finishing [Prison Break](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455275/), I decided to binge this show. But currently, I have many shits to done so I have to postpone this for later. :(

- [Agent Carter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3475734/)

  I like her.

- [Rick and Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/)

  Wabba labba dub dub!
