## Currently learning

-   [The Web Developer Bootcamp - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
    It's where my journey to web development began. I did many practices and projects while doing this course, despite haven't finished it yet.

-   [Germany - Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/course/de/en/Learn-German)
    I think it's cool to be a polyglot. Now, I am able to speak Indonesian, English, Arabic, and Deutsch (a bit). Not to show off! :)

-   Calculus and discrete mathematics. 
    Yea. I'm in semester 3 now and the mathy things are getting worse.

## Currently working on

-   [MyQeena website](https://myqeena.my.id)
    A landing page for a local leather bag brand. Actually I haven't started working on it yet, and the site is still generated with [Fruitition](https://fruitionsite.com/).

-   [My personal website](https://mufidu.com)
    This is the site you are visiting now. I haven't started this one, either ðŸ˜…. As you can see in [the repo](https://github.com/mufidu/mufidu.com), it's all just markdown. Generated to HTML by Jekyll, automatically after every `git push`.

## Currently watching

-   [Breaking Bad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/)
    Many people in Quora say that this is the best show airing right now. So, after finishing [Prison Break](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455275/), I decided to binge this show. But currently, I have many shits to done so I have to postpone this for later. :(

-   [Loki](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140554/)
    Why not? I'm a Marvel guy. I admit that this series has some flaws, but it is still fun to watch, tho.
