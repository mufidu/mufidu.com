It's a pity that we used to answer "Because I said so!", when the kids ask "Why?" repeatedly. Yes it's annoying but it's also a good thing. It's a sign that they are curious and want to understand the world around them.

I think that also explains why adults never ask "Why?" again. 

Wait I am terrible at explaining this. Just read [this](https://fs.blog/first-principles/) instead. It's a good read I promise.
