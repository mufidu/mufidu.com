If you are planning a project, try to merge the existing steps as much as possible.

Don't give a step its own time if the step can be merged with another. Merge and merge! Because every time we start a step, there is always an entry cost that must be paid (turning on the computer, getting out of bed, etc.).

If they are combined, then the entry cost is just needed once!

That's why indie hackers work very fast! They don't overcomplicate things.

Make sure to also be [efficient](/efficient/) and [focus](/focus/).
