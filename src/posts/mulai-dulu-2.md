Every time we want to do something, if it's not too important or not fun, it's very likely that we will procrastinate. Because it's not really urgent to do it now. Like studying, jogging, reading a book, etc. Even though, we really want to be able to do that. So, what's next?

Mel Robbins once said,

> "If you have an instinct to act on a goal, you must physically move within 5 seconds or your brain will kill it."

That's right. It means that if, for example, we suddenly have a desire to study, we should quickly grab a book first, even if it's just placed on the table. If we want to go jogging, take our shoes first, even if we just put them in front of the door.

The important thing is that we make our brains think we really want and need to do it.

Then, because there is progress, like it or not, our brains must be compelled to finish what we have started. This has really worked for me personally, so that I can consistently write on this blog.

Every time I have a new idea, I'll definitely write it down it in Evernote. Then I'll be encouraged to complete the writing, edit it, and then publish it.

There is also a ** two-minute rule**. It goes like this; force us to do it for at least two minutes. After that, we can stop. Usually, as long as we have started, we will continue for more than two minutes, because we feel responsible.

The important thing is to start first.
