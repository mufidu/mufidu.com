I recently listened to [Podcast Subjective](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6w1Ye8daTo1PMnrCADIV5Z?si=5KBSlb2nQrSdJg3PnagIEg), which I thought was really cool. Iqbal explained a hypothesis that the human age has phases. The age of 20-30 is for learning, 30-40 is for mastering skills, and 40 is the peak period.

For me, who is still 18, I am a little relieved. Because I am still diligent in studying and reading books. But the more I know, the more I realize that there's still a lot I don't know. I started to feel overwhelmed with so many things I wanted to learn.

Luckily, I'm still 18, which isn't even 20 yet. It's not that I can relax, but at least I can be calm because I don't have to master all things right now. God willing, there will be many years to come. Start with the basics first, and don't rush to become an expert.

Likewise, with relationships, I don't have to get a candidate now, ahah, I don't have to start looking for anyone, because there should be many other priorities that I have to work on before I go there. It's still far away.
