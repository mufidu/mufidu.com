We've heard the infamous story of Bill Gates' commitment to developing Microsoft in the early days. He was even willing to drop out of Harvard in order to build his company.

Usually, the lesson taken from Bill's dropout story is that we must have 100% total commitment when doing anything. Don't do things half-heartedly, and take risks as big as possible.

But actually, he himself said that [don't just drop out from college](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/dropping-out-of-college-is-not-a-good-idea-says-bill-gates/articleshow/5843814.cms) to pursue a business without a clear future.

Bill Gates is not the greatest risk-taker, he is the greatest risk-balancer.
