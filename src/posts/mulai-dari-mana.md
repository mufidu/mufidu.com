Even though we already know where we are going, we still can't arrive if we don't know where we are. So before we go, make sure we know where we are so that we can know which way is faster to get to our destination.

Sometimes there are times when we need to stop from everything, taking a break. Don't keep going without knowing if we are going the wrong way. Take one moment every few weeks or days, or months, to evaluate and self-reflect.

At this time, look at what we've been working on lately, which parts are still lacking and not optimal, which ones can be developed again, and most importantly, which ones don't give any progress at all.

Don't be afraid to leave anything that doesn't give you progress. Keep doing it is the same as going backwards, because the others keep moving forward, and they don't care if we're still here, left behind.
