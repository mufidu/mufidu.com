These are things I'm doing at the moment. Part of [/now movement](https://nownownow.com).

## Currently reading

- [A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers)

  Talking about how to learn effectively, especially in math and science. Nice book.

## Currently learning

- [Being A Front-End Web Developer Expert](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/219/)

  I enroll this course as a part of [IDCamp 2021](https://idcamp.indosatooredoo.com/).

- [The Web Developer Bootcamp - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

  It's where my journey to web development began. I did many practices and projects while doing this course, but still haven't finished it yet.

- [Spanish - Duolingo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6468322/)

  So I can watch [Money Heist](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6468322/) without subtitle.

## Currently working on

- [My personal website](https://mufidu.com)

  This is the very website you are visiting now. I just started rebuilding this website, using 11ty and [this theme](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog). Just started to customizing it.

## Currently watching

- [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/)

  The origin story of two legendary League of Legends characters, Jinx and Vy. I don't play the game, but their series is really worth watching.
