Welcome to my (so-called) project showcase!

Here are some of them:

-   Front-end Intro

    [Live site](https://mufidu.github.io/frontend-intro) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/frontend-intro)

    A website built for introducing Front-end Web Development.

-   Nexter

    [Live site](https://mufidu.github.io/nexter) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/nexter)

    A CSS project implementing Tailwind, Sass, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and more.

-   Natours

    [Live site](https://mufidu.github.io/natours) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/natours)

    A tour and travel website project, focusing on applying effect and maximizing CSS potentials, but currently not using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
    Built without JavaScript at all.

-   To Do List

    [Live site](https://mufidu.github.io/todolist/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/todolist/)

    Just a usual todolist web app, built using Tailwind, Sass, and some JavaScript so it can save the tasks in the browser's local storage.

-   Tailwind and Sass Starter Template

    [Live site](https://mufidu.github.io/tailwind-sass-starter/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/tailwind-sass-starter)

    A plain starter template for using Tailwind with Sass (without Next, Gatsby, Laravel, etc). Built for my personal use, since I'll hate setting up this stuff again. Once is enough.

-   MyQeena Landing Page

    [Live site](https://myqeena.my.id) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/myqeena.my.id)

    A very simple Linktree-alike landing page I made for a local bag brand.

-   ... and the [minis](https://mufidu.github.io/minis)
